# 干饭协会的扮装节

## Description

In the $\text{EatMore}$ Union, there are $n$ characters present at the party to celebrate the$~$_Cosplay Festival_$~$(扮装节).

They enjoy cosplaying others in this party, and if $a$ can cost $x$ to cosplay $b$, and $b$ can cost $y$ to cosplay $c$, then we conclude that $a$ can also cost $x + y$ to cosplay $c$. 

For example, let $a$ be$~$_Pikachu_$~$(皮卡丘), $b$ be$~$_Shin-Chan_$~$(蜡笔小新), $c$ be$~$_Naruto_$~$(鸣人), then we conclude cosplaying relations as described in the figure below:

By the way, one can always cosplay himself/herself without any cost, i.e. $a$ costs $0$ to cosplay $a$. 

You are given $m$ cosplaying relations, described as $3$ integers $a, b, w$, meaning that $a$ can cost $w$ to cosplay $b$. 

Note that $a$ may have several ways with different cost $w$ to cosplay $b$ (see Sample Input #1), and it is guaranteed that $a~\cancel{=}~b$.

You are also given $q$ querys. In each query, there are $2$ integers $x, y$ — if $x~$**cannot**$~$cosplay $y$, output $-1$; otherwise, output the minimal cost for $x$ to cosplay $y$. 

## Input Format

The first line contains $3$ integers $n$, $m$, and $q$ ( $1 \leqslant n \leqslant 600, 1 \leqslant m \leqslant {10}^{3}, 1 \leqslant q \leqslant {10}^{5}$ ) — the number of people in this town, the number of cosplaying relations, and the number of querys. 

Then $m$ lines follow, where $i$-th line contains $3$ integers $a_i, b_i, w_i$ ( $ 1 \leqslant a_i, b_i \leqslant n$, $1 \leqslant w_i \leqslant {10}^6$, $a_i~\cancel{=}~b_i$, $1 \leqslant i \leqslant m$ ) , meaning that $a_i$ costs $w_i$ to cosplay $b_i$. 

Then $q$ lines follow, where $j$-th line contains two integers $x_j$ and $y_j$ ( $ 1 \leqslant x_j, y_j \leqslant n$, $1 \leqslant j \leqslant q$ ) , representing a query — if $x_j~$**cannot**$~$cosplay $y_j$, output $-1$; otherwise, output the minimal cost for $x_j$ to cosplay $y_j$. 

## Output Format

Output $q$ lines, where $j$-th line represents the answer to $j$-th query.
